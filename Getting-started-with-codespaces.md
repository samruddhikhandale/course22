# Using Codespaces to work with the "Practical Deep Learning for Coders" course


To get started, create a codespace for this repository by clicking this ðŸ‘‡ 

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=codespaces-devcontainer&repo=530261170&machine=premiumLinux&location=WestUs2&devcontainer_path=.devcontainer%2Fdevcontainer.json)

A codespace will open in a web-based version of Visual Studio Code.

## Opening the notebooks

The [devcontainer](https://github.com/fastai/course22/tree/master/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) is fully configured with softwares and [machine learning libraries](requirements.txt) needed for this course.

In the VS Code editor, open any notebook file and start executing the notebook's cells.

## Opening your codespace in JupyterLab

You can open your codespace in JupyterLab from the "Your codespaces" page at [github.com/codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces), or by using GitHub CLI. For more information, see "[Opening an existing codespace](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/opening-an-existing-codespace)".
